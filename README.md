# nyt-fetch
A Rust program that fetches the answers for a range of New York Times games.
This is a Rust port of my Python project: https://github.com/ptblnk/nytinator3000/.

## Currently supported:
- Wordle
- Connections
- Strands
- Mini

## How does this script work?
It retrieves the .json file that stores today's solutions for the selected game from the NYT servers, parses it, and then prints out the relevant data.
